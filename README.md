# Snapspace

A mobile web app used by Spacelab’s clients to tell us about their space (what they like and don’t like), by taking photos of the space, adding comments, and sending them. It also includes an administrator section for the designers to customise which questions get sent to clients (e.g. ‘Show us your favourite space to work’), and view the responses.
